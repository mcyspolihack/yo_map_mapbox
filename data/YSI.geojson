The Aspire program is aimed at improving targeted at-risk communities and neighbourhoods in the City of Mississauga.  Recent literature has emphasized the role of education as an important determinant of crime, and given the prominent role of education in an individualâ€™s life, educational experience has both significant direct and indirect effects on criminality.  In modern societies, an individualâ€™s life trajectory â€“ including an individualâ€™s involvement in criminal activity â€“ is increasingly determined by his or her educational experiences.  In the early 1990â€™s, criminologists John Laub and Robert Sampson conducted research that demonstrated that school attitudes and performance (as measured by grades) affect delinquency rates.  High grade point averages and positive student attitudes toward school have been shown to reduce the likelihood of adolescent criminal behaviour.  To demonstrate, according to the U.S Department of Justice, only about 28% of incarcerated individuals in state and federal prisons have successfully graduated from high school. It is important to note that education is not merely a process that involves teaching the academics. It also includes teaching children social skills which help students feel more competent at school, at home, and in the community. Developing social skills at school is as significant as the academic domain. Learning how to get along with others, developing friendships, and establishing a positive out-look on life are critical. Students who are without social skills development experience rejection from classmates and learn to avoid social situations. Feelings of hurt and disappointment are the outcome and affect the child's ability to feel positive about school, peers and life in general.   The Roots of Youth Violence Report says that serious problems are being encountered in neighbourhoods trapped in a downward cycle of disadvantage where there are challenges to provide positive role-modeling to the children and youth.  Where poverty is an issue, this is a significant risk factor for involvement in criminal activity. While research concerning the relationship between poverty and crime does not show that poverty causes crime, Canadians living in poverty are over-represented in the offender population. The socio-economic difficulties faced by those living in poverty may increase the likelihood that an individual will become involved in criminal activity.  We firmly believe that providing these children and youth with a positive role model will make a difference in these communities.", "Participants_Racializedyouth": 1, "Participants_Newcomeryouth": 1, "Participants_Aboriginalyouth": 0, "Participants_YouthwDisability": 1, "Participants_YouthLeavingCare": 1, "Participants_Francophoneyouth": 1, "Participants_LBGTTQyouth": 0, "Participants_YouthLowIncome": 1, "Participants_YouthConflictwLaw": 0, "Program_Practice_Model_Notes": "place-based, community operated crime prevention program rooted in education (tutoring) and crime prevention through social development", "Program_Outcomes": "Yes", "Program_Outcomes_Notes": "?

The program provides participants with a learning environment to expand their social and professional skills while practicing the daily responsibilities of adulthood. LIFE Torontoâ€™s goal is to bridge the gap between child and adult services by providing participants with new skills and resources. LIFE Toronto is a combination of Life Skills Workshops, Transit Training, weekly Social & Recreational Outings, and Conductive Education.   In conjunction with our sponsors United Way and TD, March of Dimes Canada is offering a ten week LIFE program in Toronto, Ontario. The program is offered four times per year.   Opportunities for real-life application in the community will be encountered during the Social & Recreational Outings. These Outings include trips to Toronto Island, a day bowling, visiting parks, nature hikes, swimming, going to lunch and a movie, participating in organized sports at Variety Village and many others.   Along with the fun and adventure, you will experience some challenges. Indeed, the very purpose of the program is to help you find untapped resources within yourself and within your group, to help you discover that you are more capable than you know. This is one of the huge benefits of this disability management program for young adults. The complimentary components of the program will foster independence within the individual.

Catering to the unique needs of youth and young adults, this service builds on individual strengths to develop coping skills to enable a smooth transition into adulthood with minimal or no familial involvement.  Youth meet with the clinical staff at a mutually agreeable location, usually at the main office, Nexus Youth Centre (NYC), or another community location that meets the youthâ€™s needs. Entry to counselling is through a single session model called Step One to Success (SOS). A plan to achieve goals is centered on the youthâ€™s needs, wishes, capacity and preferences. Some of the recommended interventions may be seamlessly accessed through Nexus Youth Centreâ€™s formal programs (such as life-skills or social groups).  â€¢\tLocated in the Mississauga Central Library, Nexus Youth Centre (NYC), offers drop-in services, and formal programming through the utilization of youth engagement strategies.  At NYC, youth can meet peers in a safe, welcoming place; participate in a wide range of activities to improve their social skills; learn strategies to cope with the challenges of their daily lives; and improve their job and leadership skills. Through both informal individual counselling and formal programming including groups, youth have access to a range of services dealing with social competence, diversity, and skill development. Youth engagement strategies focus on youth developing leadership skills to engage them in meaningful opportunities through their involvement at NYC. As part of this approach, an active youth engagement working group assists in developing relevant programming, and participates in decision-making processes to further the exposure and services of NYS within the Peel community.  Collaborative partnerships with community agencies, committees and planning tables support and enhance clinical service for youth in Peel.

Through the Community Resource Center youth have access to care coordination which can consist of referrals to internal and external services There are four Mental Health Clinicians who will work with youth to provide assessment, treatment and mental health wellness coordination. Three clinicians specialize in working with minority populations; one with Early Intervention Youth, one with Aboriginal Youth and one with LGBTQ+ youth with concurrent disorders. Through the Mental Health Program, all youth at Notre Dame House also have access to adolescent psychiatrists, when indicated.  Skills for Life is a DBT\/Mindfulness based program developed by the Mental Health team at Good Shepherd Youth Services. The curriculum teaches youth and their families positive Skills for managing and coping with thoughts, feelings and behaviors. All youth are able to participate in weekly programming that teaches and reinforces these Skills. All Youth Services staff are trained in the Skills for Life Program and can teach and provide coaching of the Skills with youth. Another service all youth are able to access a Housing Worker. Notre Dame House has three Housing Workers, each who works with a specific population to provide youth specialized support, depending on their individual needs. To address the continuum of homelessness, there is one worker who supports youth who have never been exposed to the shelter system. This Early Intervention Worker collaborates with youth and their families to divert the youth back to the family home, whenever it is safe. The Youth Homelessness Prevention worker works with youth who are currently in shelter or who may be experiencing precarious housing in the community, to find, obtain and maintain safe and adequate housing. The Intensive Community Case Manager works from a Housing First framework, to assist youth who have experienced chronic or episodic homelessness. The Intensive Community Case Managersâ€™ focus is to help youth find safe and adequate housing, connecting them with any and all supports they need to maintain this housing.  All youth are also able to receive confidential medical care through several on-site medical clinics. A Doctor, a Nurse and a Public Health Sexual Health Nurse will meet with youth for a variety of reasons. Youth may receive referrals, ongoing treatment, medication, medical testing and harm reduction education through these clinics. Through these medical clinics and a partnership with the Shelter Health Networkâ€™s Hepatitis C team youth are able to receive prompt and cohesive services to prevent and treat blood borne illnesses.     Another service is on-site Addictions Counselling (Alternatives for Youth). AY offers ongoing counselling, referrals to treatment centers and harm reduction education, as well as supports youth with concurrent disorders. There is a weekly Legal Clinic where youth can receive confidential legal advice on a variety of matters including criminal law, family law, and housing and mental health law. Another clinic that runs during the drop-in hours of CRC is the Employment Preparation Program. This program assists youth with employment searching, resume building and employment readiness.    Every youth is invited to participate in programming. All programming is created based on one of our principals of programming: 1) Life Skills (including how to budget, grocery shop and prepare a meal, how to go to a Laundromat to complete laundry, etc.), 2) Skills for Life (coping with thoughts, feelings and behaviour), 3) Recreation (involving youth in activities to help build confidence and mastery) and 4) Community Engagement. The CRC also provides youth with access to clothing donations, housing donations and a hot meal program two times daily. All of these initiatives help to relieve some of the financial burden felt by a young person living independently, which is crucial for them to maintain housing. Notre Dame House is often the first step for youth in their journey to continuing education. Many referrals for the Notre Dame House School come from the CRC.  The Notre Dame House School is a Section 23 Classroom, assisting street involved and homeless youth in re-engaging in the education sector through alternative learning. The Notre Dame House School provides many opportunities to assist youth in obtaining their high school diploma including cooperative education opportunities, independent booklet study and artistic opportunities. There is a Post-Secondary Liaison who attends the school bi-weekly to discuss with youth their options for post-secondary education, and assist them in the application process. Any youth who accesses the CRC or lives in the shelter has the ability to meet with this worker as well. At Notre Dame House youth are supported in connecting with cultural and spiritual services that can help them re-establish connections with their own culture and\/or spirituality.", "Participants_Racializedyouth": 1, "Participants_Newcomeryouth": 1, "Participants_Aboriginalyouth": 1, "Participants_YouthwDisability": 1, "Participants_YouthLeavingCare": 1, "Participants_Francophoneyouth": 1, "Participants_LBGTTQyouth": 1, "Participants_YouthLowIncome": 1, "Participants_YouthConflictwLaw": 1, "Program_Practice_Model_Notes": null, "Program_Outcomes": "Yes", "Program_Outcomes_Notes": null, "Outcomes1": "4 - Ontario youth have families and guardians equipped to help them thrive", "Outcomes2": "3 - Ontario youth make choices that support healthy and safe development", "Outcomes3": null, "Evaluation_Planning_Tools": "No", "Evaluation_Staff": "Yes", "Evaluation_History": "Yes", "Evaluation_Reports": "No", "Program_Funder": "The City of Hamilton; primarily donor dollars", "Program_Future": "Yes", "Program_Future_Notes": null, "Organization_Legal_Status": "Registered charitable organization", "Organization_Legal_Status_Notes": null, "Program_Targets_Age": "Only youth", "Youth_Led": "No", "Program_Financial_Arrangement": "Yes" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.8680087, 43.2611571 ] } },

Providing youth with a safe, accepting and welcome environment to land has many positive impacts on the youth themselves, as well as the local community. The Notre Dame House shelter helps decrease the number of youth living in invisible homelessness, and works to decrease the volume of youth who have to become involved in high-risk activities such as transactional sex work, gang involvement and drug dealing by supporting them in securing a place to live â€“ which in turn increases the chances that a youth who experiences homelessness will be able to be able to begin making steps towards positive life changes and lifting themselves of out poverty. The Notre Dame House Emergency shelter will assist a youth in meeting their immediate needs.

As a society, we cast them into independence with some modest financial benefits, but mostly they leave foster care or their group home with no backup plan, no community, no one looking out for them. Then we ask them to walk the high-wire to adulthood essentially on their own.  To succeed they need to know someone has their back; that theyâ€™re not alone; that their personal success matters to us all.  JF&CS founded the Pearl Project to help balance their practical needs for skills and information with their need for community, connections and long term commitment. As a Jewish community we want them to know they matter to us, that we have their backs.
