#PoliHack Product - Youth Opportunities Webmap

###Goal: To make a web platform to communicate and disseminate knowledge of the Youth Opportunities Programs in Ontario


SteppingUp: A Strategic Framework to Help Ontario’s Youth Succeed is Ontario’s overall, whole-of-government strategy for improving outcomes for youth aged 12-25.
SteppingUp is based on seven themes, 20 outcomes, and 52 indicators of youth wellbeing.
It was created based on the developmental evidence included in Stepping Stones: A Framework to Support Positive Youth Development.
Reports to the public on the government’s progress in investing in youth are developed on an annual basis.
The framework acknowledges the requirement for targeted action in specific areas where outcomes can be improved (e.g. youth unemployment, youth violence).
Outcomes in these areas are monitored through SteppingUp’s Profile of Youth Wellbeing (e.g. youth crime rates).
Through initiatives like the Youth Action Plan, the government has made recent investments to extend the availability of Youth Opportunities programs to more communities across the province and to increase the number of opportunities that are available.
These programs are a part of the Ontario Youth Strategy is MCYS’ tool for rallying partners from across multiple sectors to improve outcomes for youth.
The strategy focuses on providing equitable and targeted supports for sub-populations of youth (e.g Indigenous youth, newcomer youth) that may also face barriers to success.
